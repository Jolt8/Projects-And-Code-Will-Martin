#these times are all after the program has compiled

#How much does first time compilation take on a 1x1 grid vs a 10x10 grid
#if the compilation time (not the total time to run the file) is less on the 1x1 grid, would it be a good idea to initialize it with the simplest grid possible 
#then run a more complex grid?

#I wonder what takes more time a 1x16, 2x8, 4x4 grid

#the good news is that even if a grid that was previously compiled is used again after being replaced it will not have to 
#recompile and you'll get the 100% recompilation time
#ex. setting it to (1, 16) running it, changing to (2, 8), running (1, 16) again preserves compilation

#also, usually the time it takes to recompile (not simulation) goes down slightly every time you run it

#also, changing a parameter like C of each heat capacitor does not require another simulation (only recompilation) which is actually REALLY good

#after looking at this in sheets the first time to run seems to be T(n log n) and the second time to run seems like halfway between T(n log n) and T(n^2)
